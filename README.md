# administration
This repository holds primary responsibility for administering the Amazon Picking Challenge git organization.

# Organization organization
The [Amazon Picking Challenge Git Organization](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge) is the place to display and collaborate on software that was created for the [Amazon Picking Challenge](http://amazonpickingchallenge.org/).

## Repos and Teams
Each team that participated in the [APC](http://amazonpickingchallenge.org/) is assigned their own public **repository**.  Each of these repositories has an associated **team**, whose members have read/write access to their repository.  Only team members have write (push) access to *their* repository; all repositories are publicly readable.

### Initial Team Setup
Each team must appoint at least one [team maintainer](https://help.github.com/articles/giving-team-maintainer-permissions-to-an-organization-member-early-access-program/).  The **team maintainer** has the capability to [add](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-organization-members-to-a-team-early-access-program/) and [remove](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-organization-members-from-a-team-early-access-program/) members from the team.

In order to become the first **team maintainer**, create an [issue](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration/issues/new) in the [administration](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration) repository with your request.  Please include your github user name and the [team](https://github.com/orgs/amazon-picking-challenge/teams) name in the request.

Once a team maintainer has been established, they can add additional team members *and* maintainers.

### Initial Repository Setup
There are many ways to commit your code - Here are two!

##### Standard clone & commit
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your repository [(look here)](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge).
2. [Add your files](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-from-the-command-line/) to the local clone.
3. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) the changes.

##### Fork an existing github repository
1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration/issues/new) requesting that an administrator fork your existing github repo.  Please include the team name, and the exact web address of the github repository in the request.
