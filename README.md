# administration
This repository holds primary responsibility for administering the Picking Challenge git organization.

### A note on getting help with these directions
Please [create an issue](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration/issues/new) to get help.  Please avoid posting any git-related problems to the mailing list.  Issues will be much better addressed in this forum.

# Organization of the organization
The [Picking Challenge Git Organization](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge) is the venue to display and collaborate on software that was created for picking challenges, most notably the [Amazon Picking Challenge](http://amazonpickingchallenge.org/).

## Repos and Teams
Each team that participated in a picking challenge is assigned their own public **repository**.  Each of these repositories has an associated **team**, whose members have read/write access to their repository.  Only team members have write (push) access to *their* repository; all repositories are publicly readable.

### Initial Team Setup
Each team must appoint at least one [team maintainer](https://help.github.com/articles/giving-team-maintainer-permissions-to-an-organization-member-early-access-program/).  The **team maintainer** has the capability to [add](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-organization-members-to-a-team-early-access-program/) and [remove](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-organization-members-from-a-team-early-access-program/) members from the team.

In order to become the first **team maintainer**, create an [issue](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration/issues/new) in the [administration](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration) repository with your request.  Please include your github user name and the [team](https://github.com/orgs/amazon-picking-challenge/teams) name in the request.

Once a team maintainer has been established, they can add additional team members *and* maintainers.

### Initial Repository Setup
There are many ways to commit your code - Here are two!

##### Standard clone & commit
This option is straight-forward.  It assumes that a copy of the project exists on a local machine.

1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your team's repository from [here](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge) to the local machine.
2. [Add your files](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-from-the-command-line/) to the local repository.
3. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) the changes back to the APC organization.

##### Fork an existing github repository
This option is a shortcut for teams who already have their project hosted on github *in a single repository*.

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration/issues/new) in this repository asking an administrator to fork your existing github repo.  In your request, please include the team name, and the exact web address of the github repository that will be forked.

### Request Help
Anyone can request help working with the [APC repositories](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge).  The easiest way is to [create an issue](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration/issues/new) in the [administration](https://github.com/amazon-picking-challenge/administration) repository.
